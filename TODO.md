# TODO

## Notes

- Cannot see error messages when running commands from the TUI
- Find a way to get error / success status from dot operations and show them in the TUI

## Features

- Finish implementing MVP bubbletea TUI
- Getting profile path for TUI: Enter path / Search / Config ?
- Better backups handling

## Testing

- Write unit tests!

## Prettify

- Better lipgloss styling
- Tidy up cobra CLI setup

## Later

- Templates: Create initial dotty.map profiles based on OS templates
- Fun animation! little dots bouncing onto the screen onto the paths
- Proper deploy / install setup
- Extend dotty.map file?
    copy .zshrc : ~/.zshrc
    run install.sh
    etc...


## Ideas

- Auto search for dotty.map files for loading a profile
- When profile is loaded show the maps
    abc => ~/dotfiles/abc
- When running cmd change styles on the map to indicate the process
