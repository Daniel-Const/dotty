# Dotty

A simple Dot file manager!

- Manage dot files in one git repository
- Create multiple profiles and easily switch between them
- Fun and sassy?

## Problem

I have multiple devices with different operating systems and want to be able to configure them
separatley, but in the same place

## Solution

A Go CLI app that automatically copies all of the dot files to the right location :)
